#### VMware

1.  **What's VMware**

VMware is **Virtualization** and **Cloud Computing** sofware provider based in Palo Alton, California. 
Founded in 1998, VMware is a subsidiary of Dell Technologies. EMC Corporation originally acquired VMware in 2004; EMC was later acquired by Dell Technologies in 2016.
VMware bases its virtualization technologies on its **bare-metal hypervisor** ESX/ESXi in x86 architecture.

With VMware server virtualization, a hypervisor is installed on the physical server to allow for mutiple Vitual Machines(VMs) to run on the same physical server.
Each VM can run its own **operating system(OS)**, which means mutiple OSes can run on one physical machine. All of the VMs on the same physical server share resources, such as networking and RAM.
