## Basic protocols

##### Telnet
*telnet* was one of the first Internet standards, developed in 1969, and is the chameleon of protocols - it specialty is terminal emulation. It allows a user on a remote client machine, called the Telnet client, to access the resources of another machine, the Telnet server, in order to access a Command-Line Interface. Telnet achieves this by pulling a fast one  on the Telnet server and making the client machine appear as though it were a terminal directly attached to
the local network. This projection is actually a software image—a virtual terminal that can
interact with the chosen remote host. A drawback is that there are no encryption techniques
available within the Telnet protocol, so everything must be sent in clear text, including passwords! Following figure shows an example of a Telnet client trying to connect to a Telnet server.

These emulated terminals are of the text-mode type and can execute defned procedures
such as displaying menus that give users the opportunity to choose options and access the
applications on the duped server. Users begin a Telnet session by running the Telnet client
software and then logging into the Telnet server. Telnet uses an 8-bit, byte-oriented data
connection over TCP, which makes it very thorough. It’s still in use today because it is so
simple and easy to use, with very low overhead, but again, with everything sent in clear
text, it’s not recommended in production.
