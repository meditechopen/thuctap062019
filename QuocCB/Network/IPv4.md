#### Network addressing

The network address uniquely identifies each network. Every machine on the same network shares that network address as part of its IP address.
For example,in the IP address 172.16.30.56, 172.16 is network address.

   The node address is assigned to, and uniquely identifies, each machine on a network.
This part of the address must be unique because it identifies a particular machine -- an individual -- as opposed to the network,
which is a group. This number can also be referred to as a host address. In the sample IP address 172.16.30.56, the 30.56 specifes the node address.

#### Network Address Range
**Define the Class A IP address range:**

The IP range for a Class A network is 1–126. This
provides 8 bits of network addressing and 24 bits of host addressing by default.

**Define the Class B IP address range:**

The IP range for a Class B network is 128–191. Class B addressing provides 16 bits of network addressing and 16 bits of host addressing by default.

**Define the Class C IP address range:**

The IP range for a Class C network is 192 through 223. Class C addressing provides 24 bits of network addressing and 8 bits of host addressing by default.

**Identify the private IP ranges:** 

The Class A private address range is 10.0.0.0 through 10.255.255.255. 

The Class B private address range is 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.255.255.

The Class C private address range is 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.255.

**Understand the difference between a broadcast, unicast, and multicast address:**

**A Broadcast** is to all devices in a subnet.

**A Unicast** is to one device.

**A Multicast** is to some but not all devices.
