### Introduction to Linux

#### History
Linux, like Mac OS X, is based on the Unix operating system. A research team at AT&T’s Bell Labs developed Unix in the late 1960s and early 1970s with a focus on creating an operating system that would be accessible and secure for multiple users.

Corporations started licensing Unix in the 1980s and 1990s. By the late 1980s, there was interest in building a free operating system that would be similar to Unix, but that could be tinkered with and redistributed. In 1991, Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel as free, open-source software. Open source means that the code is fully visible, and can be modified and redistributed.

Strictly speaking, Linux is the kernel, not the entire operating system. The kernel provides an interface between your Linode’s hardware and the input/output requests from applications. The rest of the operating system usually includes many GNU libraries, utilities, and other software, from the Free Software Foundation. The operating system as a whole is known as GNU/Linux.

#### Distributions

 Linux comes in several different versions known as distributions. Different distributions are somewhat similar to operating system versions like Windows 7 or Windows 10, except Linux distributions aren’t upgraded versions of each other, but rather different yet similar flavors of Linux. Different distributions install different default bundles of software.

###### Widely used distributions

- Debian, a non-commercial distribution and one of the earliest, maintained by a volunteer developer community with a strong commitment to free software principles and democratic project management

    - Knoppix
    - Ubuntu
    - Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE)
- Fedora, a community distribution sponsored by American company Red Hat and the successor to the company's previous offering, Red Hat Linux. It aims to be a technology testbed for Red Hat's commercial Linux offering, where new open source software is prototyped, developed, and tested in a communal setting before maturing into Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

    - Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL): CentOS, Oracle Linux, Scientific Linux.
