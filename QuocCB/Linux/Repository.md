#### What Are Repositories?

A software repository contains software packages.<br>
When you search via the Software Centre or use a tool like apt-get or yum you are shown a list of all the packages within the repositories available to your system.
<br>A software repository can store its files on one server or across many different servers known as mirrors.



### Why Local repository is important?

As a System administrator, you have to install software, security updates and fixes often in all systems.
Obviously, it will consume more Internet bandwidth. 
So instead of downloading and installing applications every time in all systems from the Ubuntu repositories, it is good idea to save all applications in a local server in your LAN and distribute them to the other Ubuntu systems when required. 
Having a local repository is really fast and efficient way, because all required applications will be transferred over the fast LAN connection from your local server. 
So that it will save the Internet bandwidth and ultimately it reduces the annual cost of Internet.
